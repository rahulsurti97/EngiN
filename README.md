The Mobile Engineering Notebook

Goal for this project is to create a mobile application that could replace conventional engineering notebooks by creating a platform to document ideas quickly and efficiently, as well as automate repetitive tasks to speed up the documentation process as a whole.

Implemented Features:

    Library contains list of all projects.
    Project Home contains all entries, team members, and project description.
    Upon "Add" of Project or Entry, user is prompted to give unique title.
    Entry is view-only until edit button is pressed; edit button then becomes save button.  User can save save entry before returning to home to keep changes.
    Team Members tab in Entry has ability to checkmark which team members were present in that meeting.  Follows same protocol for saving as Entry.
    Project Description follows same protocol for saving as Entry.

For best use of this application, use iPhone 5S (4 inch).
