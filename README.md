The Mobile Engineering Notebook

Goal for this project is to create a mobile application that could replace conventional engineering notebooks by creating a platform to document ideas quickly and efficiently, as well as automate repetitive tasks to speed up the documentation process as a whole.

Implemented Features:
-Library contains list of all projects.
-Project Home contains all entries, team members, and project description.
-Upon "Add" of Project or Entry, user is prompted to give unique title.
-Entry is view-only until edit button is pressed; edit button then becomes save button.  User can save save entry before returning to home to keep changes.
-Team Members tab in Entry has ability to checkmark which team members were present in that meeting.  Follows same protocol for saving as Entry.
-Project Description follows same protocol for saving as Entry.

For best use of this application, use iPhone 5S (4 inch).
